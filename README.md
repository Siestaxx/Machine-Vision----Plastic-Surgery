# Machine-Vision----Plastic-Surgery

Gathered the dataset (2000 images) for Asian pre and post plasitic surgery images

Used various models to train a model that can accurately classify a given image to see whether it is pre or post plastic surgery

Used facial landmark and ratio of faces to detect specific surgery

Used GANs to inter generate pre and post surgery photos
